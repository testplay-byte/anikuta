## What's done (Phases 0–7, all on `main`)

| Phase | Status | Summary |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0 — Foundation | ✅ Done | Planning, decisions D1–D4, aniyomi copied to `REFERENCE/` |
| 1 — Skeleton + onboarding | ✅ Done | 5-module Gradle project, GitHub Actions, Injekt DI, M3 theme, 7-step onboarding, bottom nav |
| 2 — AniList + home | ✅ Done | AniList GraphQL client, 3-step cache (Local→Supabase→AniList), home page |
| 3 — Detail + episodes | ✅ Done | Detail page (hero, description, episodes), AniyomiSourceBridge fuzzy matching |
| 4 — Player (MPV) | ✅ Done + user-verified | MPV streaming, controls, progress save/resume |
| 5 — Library/History/Search | ✅ Done | Core navigation pages, source wiring, watch progress |
| 6 — Functionality + polish | ✅ Done | Settings reorg, player UX, extension mgmt, AniList tracking, downloads, error handling |
| 7 — Backend improvements | ✅ Done | Extension trust + repos, episode caching, 3-stage pull-to-refresh, video picker, downloads drag-and-drop, floating nav, onboarding permissions |
| 7.5 — Episode list enhancements | ✅ Done | Thumbnails, titles, summaries, auto-fetch from AniList + Jikan/MAL (`EpisodeMetadataFetcher`), toggles in settings (`MetadataSettingsScreen`, `PlayerEpisodeDisplayScreen`, `DisplaySettingsScreen`, `LayoutSettingsScreen`, `DetailsSettingsScreen`), live preview (`EpisodeRowPreview`) |

## Known issues (open)

31 triaged issues in `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`: **3 CRITICAL, 4 HIGH, 8 MEDIUM, 16 LOW**.
Most are open/deferred. The 3 CRITICAL are player-related (race conditions found in the Session 44 code review — not yet fixed; the player works but is fragile).

---

## Key risk areas (handle with extra caution)

1. **`PlayerActivity.kt` (2,430 LoC god object)** — all player business logic in one Activity; `PlayerViewModel` is just a state bag. Refactor deferred (awaiting user decision). See `DOCS/ENGINEERING/MODULARIZATION-ASSESSMENT.md` P0.4.
2. **MPV native lifecycle** — `MPVLib.initialize()` runs once per process; re-init crashes the app. Has broken and been re-fixed multiple times.
3. **Zero SQLDelight migrations** — the first schema change after launch will wipe user data unless `.sqm` migrations are added. See `DOCS/ENGINEERING/MODULARIZATION-ASSESSMENT.md` P0.5.
4. **Subtitle rendering** — has broken silently multiple times (fake font, sid getter, arg order). Each fix was deep and non-obvious.
5. **Extension binary contract** — the `eu.kanade.tachiyomi.animesource.*` package names must never be renamed (breaks extension classloading — learned in Phase 5).
6. **`:app` is a 147-file monolith** — no feature-module split yet. Natural future candidates: `:feature:player`, `:feature:library`, etc.

Full risk list: `DOCS/ENGINEERING/MODULARIZATION-ASSESSMENT.md`.

## What changed recently (since the last structured session log)

`MEMORY/SESSION-LOGS/` stops at Session 31 (Library/History/Search revamp, 2026-07-15). Since then, the following landed on `main` (per `worklog.md`):

- Full download-system rebuild (modular engines, segment resume, foreground service, notifications, downloads page v1–v4, download button in player episode list). Merged via the now-deleted `player-experiment` branch (merge commit `a05d07c`).
- Library/History/Search revamp merge (commit `ca644ad`).
- Extension → AniList linking flow (auto-search + cache + manual fallback + adult filter).
- AniList browse uses `getTrending`, multi-select Year/Genre/Format filters.
- Removal of all `primaryContainer` colors from the player.

> **Note on `worklog.md`:** It is the project's historical narrative log (2,389 lines). Some of its older entries reference a "`player-experiment` branch" — those references are **historical** (written while the branch existed). That branch has been merged into `main` and deleted. All work is on `main` now.

## What's actually left (verified 2026-07-16)

The earlier "next" phase (7.5) is **already done**. The genuinely remaining work, in rough priority order:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Backup / restore** | ✅ Done (Phase 7) | Full modular backup/restore system in `app/anikuta/backup/` (16 files). Dual-format: AniKuta (.anikuta, JSON v2) + Aniyomi (.tachibk, modern proto 500-506, wire-compatible with aniyomi). 4-step restore flow: decode → summary-preview → live-progress restore → unlinked-anime review. 4-tier AniList linking (tracking → cache → fuzzy → manual). Auto-backup with configurable frequency + retention. Fixes 3 prior restore bugs (settings/category-assignments/playback-states were dropped). See `DOCS/PLAN/BACKUP-RESTORE-PLAN.md`. |
| **Auto-download** | ✅ Done (Phases N-5 + N-6) | New-release auto-download (Phase N-5) + watch-flow auto-download (Phase N-6) are both implemented. The old `DownloadPreferences` stub keys (`downloadNewEpisodes()`, etc.) are NOT consumed — the new `NotificationPreferences` system handles auto-download instead. |
| **Episode notifications** | ✅ Done (Phase N) | Full smart release-tracking system in `app/anikuta/notification/`: weighted-average timing using AniList + extension release-time learning, 3 notify modes (AniList/extension/both), sub/dub detection + separate notifications, dub-lag handling, per-anime settings (three-dot menu on detail page), quiet hours, background battery exemption, BootReceiver, deep-linking to detail page from notifications. **Fully-released anime are hidden from the tracked list and their three-dot menu shows "Nothing to configure".** See `DOCS/PLAN/NOTIFICATIONS-PLAN.md`. |
| **Auto-download (new releases)** | ✅ Done (Phase N-5) | Wired into the release tracker: when a new episode is detected + user opted in, triggers `DownloadManager.enqueueDownload()`. Global radio selector (Sub only / Dub only / Any available) + quality preference. Per-anime overrides available from the detail page three-dot menu. Lives in **Downloads settings** (not Notifications). |
| **Watch-flow auto-download** | ✅ Done (Phase N-6) | `WatchFlowAutoDownload.kt` in the player package: while watching a downloaded episode, pre-downloads the next one. One-line hook in `PlayerActivity.switchEpisode()`. Global-only setting. Lives in **Downloads settings**. |
| **Theming (Phase 9)** | Not started | `Theme.kt` has a single hardcoded Material 3 Expressive scheme (Light/Dark only). **No AMOLED, no accent presets, no design picker, no DesignSpec/DesignProvider abstraction.** The 4 designs (Material3/Dark Neon/Neobrutalism/Coffee Notebook) are documented in `DOCS/PLAN/DESIGNS/` but not implemented. |
| **Quality-of-life features** | Various | To be enumerated as the user identifies them. |
| **PlayerActivity refactor** | Deferred | 2,430-LoC god object. High value, high risk. Awaiting user go-ahead; will explain plan before touching. |
| **Statistics (Phase 8)** | Planned | See `DOCS/PLAN/STATISTICS-PLAN.md`. |

## Immediate next steps (per user direction, 2026-07-16)

1. ✅ **Documentation cleanup** — DONE (commit `1cdf9f6`).
2. ✅ **Testing layer** — DONE (commit `0226996`); 4 unit-test files, 58 cases.
3. ✅ **Phase 7.5 verification** — DONE; confirmed implemented, docs updated.
4. ✅ **Episode notifications + auto-download** — DONE (Phases N-1 through N-7 + UI v2 + settings restructure). Smart release tracking, 3 notify modes, sub/dub detection, per-anime settings, watch-flow auto-download, fully-released filtering. All on `main`.
5. ⏭️ **Next feature** — backup/restore, theming (Phase 9), or PlayerActivity refactor. Awaiting user direction.

## How to verify this file is current

- Check `git log -1 --format='%H %ci' main` — if the date is newer than this file's "Last updated" line, this file may need a refresh.
- Check `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` — if the open-issue counts above don't match, refresh.
- When in doubt, the truth is in the code (`app/`, `core/`, `data/`, `domain/`, `source-api/`) and `git log main`.

_Maintenance rule: update this file after every merge to `main` or any significant status change. Keep it to one screen._
